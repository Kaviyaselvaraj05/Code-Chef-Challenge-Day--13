01)Height of Rationals
In a recent breakthrough in mathematics, the proof utilized a concept called Height.

Consider a fraction 
a
b
b
a
​
 . Its Height is defined as the maximum of its numerator and denominator. So, for example, the Height of 
3
19
19
3
​
  would be 
19
19, and the Height of 
27
4
4
27
​
  would be 
27
27.

Given 
a
a and 
b
b, find the Height of 
a
b
b
a
​
 .

Input Format
The only line of input contains two integers, 
a
a and 
b
b.

Output Format
Output a single integer, which is the Height of 
a
b
b
a
​
 .

Constraints

Output
3 19
19
Explanation:
The maximum of 
{
3
,
19
}
{3,19} is 
19

27 4
27
Explanation:
The maximum of 
{
27
,
4
}
{27,4} is

print(max(up, down))

02)Instagram
Chef categorises an instagram account as spam, if, the following count of the account is more than 
10
10 times the count of followers.

Given the following and follower count of an account as 
X
X and 
Y
Y respectively, find whether it is a spam account.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
X
X and 
Y
Y — the following and follower count of an account, respectively.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line, YES, if the account is spam and NO otherwise.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase. For example, the strings YES, yes, Yes and yES are identical.

NO
NO
YES
YES
Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The following count is 
1
1 while the follower count is 
10
10. Since the following count is not more than 
10
10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.

Test case 
2
2: The following count is 
10
10 while the follower count is 
1
1. Since the following count is not more than 
10
10 times the follower count, the account is not spam.

Test case 
3
3: The following count is 
11
11 while the follower count is 
1
1. Since the following count is more than 
10
10 times the follower count, the account is spam.

Test case 
4
4: The following count is 
97
97 while the follower count is 
7
7. Since the following count is more than 
10
10 times the follower count, the account is spam.

ANSWER:
for t in range(int(input())):
    x,y=map(int,input().split())
    if x>y*10:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")

03)Volume Control
Chef is watching TV. The current volume of the TV is 
X
X. Pressing the volume up button of the TV remote increases the volume by 
1
1 while pressing the volume down button decreases the volume by 
1
1. Chef wants to change the volume from 
X
X to 
Y
Y. Find the minimum number of button presses required to do so.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer 
T
T - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two integers 
X
X and 
Y
Y - the initial volume and final volume of the TV.
Output Format
For each test case, output the minimum number of times Chef has to press a button to change the volume from 
X
X to 
Y
Y.

    print("NO" if (b*10)>=a else "YES")

04)ATM
Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US.

Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

Input Format
Each input contains 2 integers 
X
X and 
Y
Y.
X
X is the amount of cash which Pooja wishes to withdraw.
Y
Y is Pooja's initial account balance.

Output Format
Output the account balance after the attempted transaction, given as a number with two digits of precision. If there is not enough money in the account to complete the transaction, output the current bank balance.

    print(float(atm-n-0.5))
else:
    print(float(atm))

05)Is it hot or cold
Chef considers the climate HOT if the temperature is above 
20
20, otherwise he considers it COLD. You are given the temperature 
C
C, find whether the climate is HOT or COLD.

The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
The first and only line of each test case contains a single integer, the temperature 
C
C.
Output Format
For each test case, print on a new line whether the climate is HOT or COLD.

You may print each character of the string in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings hOt, hot, Hot, and HOT will all be treated as identical).

COLD
Explanation:
Test case 
1
1: The temperature is 
21
21, which is more than 
20
20. So, Chef considers the climate HOT.

Test case 
2
2: The temperature is 
16
16, which is not more than 
20
20. So, Chef considers the climate COLD.

ANSWER:
n,atm=map(float,input().split())
n=int(n)
